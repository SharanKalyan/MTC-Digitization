# Sri Monisha Tiffin Center – SMB Digitalization & Analytics System

## Project Context

This project began when a restaurant (SMB) owner approached me with a common but critical problem:

All sales, expenses, and employee attendance were being written manually in notebooks.
There was no visibility into daily performance, profits, or cash position, only handwritten records.

As the business grew, this manual process became:

- Error-prone
- Time-consuming
- Impossible to analyze
- Completely disconnected from decision-making

The owner wanted a simple, mobile-friendly solution that:
- Replaced pen-and-paper entries
- Required no technical knowledge
- Worked seamlessly on an Android phone
- Provided real-time visibility into business performance

This project is the result of that initiative. A full digital data entry + analytics pipeline tailored specifically for an SMB restaurant.

## Objectives

The primary goals of this system were:
- Digitize daily operational data entry
- Minimize user friction (large buttons, mobile-first UI)
- Centralize data in a single source of truth
- Provide real-time analytics without complex tools
- Track actual cash position, not just daily profit

## Solution Overview

The solution is a Streamlit-based web application backed by Google Sheets as a lightweight database.

Why this stack?

| Component                | Reason                                                   |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Streamlit**            | Rapid UI development, mobile-friendly, simple deployment |
| **Google Sheets**        | Familiar to SMB users, cloud-based, no database setup    |
| **Python + Pandas**      | Reliable analytics and data transformations              |
| **Service Account Auth** | Secure access without user login complexity              |


The app is deployed on Streamlit Cloud and accessed via a browser, often saved to the phone’s home screen like an app.

## Security Model

- PIN-based access (stored securely using Streamlit Secrets)
- Google Sheets access restricted via service account
- No public credentials exposed in the repository

## Core Functional Modules
### 1. Expense Management

Allows daily recording of expenses with:
- Date & time (editable for backdated entries)
- Category & sub-category
- Amount
- Payment mode
- Person responsible

### Outcome:
- Complete visibility into where money is spent.
- Foundation for expense trend analytics

### 2. Sales Tracking

Handles sales across multiple revenue sources:
- Bigstreet
- Main Store
- Orders

### Key features:
- Morning / Night / Full Day slots
- Overwrites duplicate entries for accuracy
- Cash-based entry (as per current business needs)

### Outcome:
- Clean daily sales data
- Store-wise and slot-wise analysis

### 3️. Employee Attendance
Attendance is recorded once per day with:
- Morning, Afternoon, Night shifts
- Grouped employee selection (mobile-optimized)
- Absentees marked explicitly
- Previous entries overwritten to avoid duplicates

### Outcome:
- Clear attendance history
- Ability to identify frequently absent employees
- Shift-wise absence analysis

### 4️. Real-Time Analytics Dashboards

Built-in dashboards provide insights such as:
- Expense Analytics
- Day-wise expense trends
- Historical expense tracking
- Sales Analytics
- Store-wise revenue breakdown
- Time-slot analysis
- Attendance Analytics
- Total absences per employee
- Shift-wise absentee trends

All analytics update in real time as data is entered.

### 5️. Daily Cash Balance Tracking (Key Feature)
One of the most important additions was running cash balance tracking.
Instead of only showing:
- Sales - Expenses = Today’s Profit

The system tracks:
- Opening balance (carried forward)
- Today’s total sales
- Today’s total expenses
- Closing balance (saved explicitly)
  
This mirrors real-world cash management in small businesses.

Example:

Yesterday Closing Balance: ₹25,000
Today Sales: ₹50,000
Today Expenses: ₹25,000

→ Today Closing Balance: ₹50,000


This gives the owner a true picture of cash-in-hand, not just daily margins.

## Data Architecture (Google Sheets)

Each operational area maps cleanly to its own sheet:
- Sheet1 → Expenses
- Attendance → Employee attendance
- Sales → Sales entries
- Daily_Balance → Opening & closing balances

This structure keeps data simple, auditable, and easy to export.

## Mobile-First Design Philosophy

Since the owner primarily uses an Android phone, the UI was designed with:
- Dropdown-based navigation (instead of tabs)
- Minimal typing
- Large clickable elements
- Simple forms
- Clear success/error feedback

The goal was usability over complexity.

## Impact & Outcomes
- Eliminated handwritten notebooks
- Reduced manual errors
- Enabled data-driven decisions
- Provided daily financial clarity
- Created a foundation for future dashboards and forecasting

Most importantly, the owner now knows:

“How is my business actually performing today, not later.”

## Future Enhancements

Potential next steps include:
- Weekly & monthly profit reports
- Automatic daily closing reminders
- Role-based access
- Export to PDF / Excel


## Final Note

This project demonstrates how simple tools, when designed correctly, can bring real operational clarity to small businesses.

It’s not about building complex systems, it’s about solving the right problem, in the right way, for the right user.
